## Formula for making your own liquid mix

How much nicotine shots do you need for given bottle volume.

Formula:

```none
    nicotine_volume = bottle_volume * nicotine_power

    nicotine_volume - how much mg of nicotine do we need to add to given bottle to achieve certain amount of nicotine per ml in that bottle
    bottle_volume - self explanatory
    nicotine_power - how much mg of nicotine per ml of liquid do we want in that bottle
```

E.g. for 100ml bottle, to achieve 6mg nicotine per ml, you need 3 shots that have 20mg nicotine per ml.
